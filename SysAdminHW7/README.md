In this assignment, I created an Ansible controller that can spin up 10 web servers which are based on my custom Docker image.

This repository contains my shell script, my Ansible playbook and a docx file that if contained contains:

1. My name. 
2. My Docker Hub username. 
3. The names of my shell script and Ansible playbook. 
4. My private SSH key, saved as id_rsa

And finally, 

5. Complete instructions on how to prepare and then run my Ansible playbook 
and my shell script, and what the expected output should be, culminating in 
the output of the shell script.
